# deep-rock-galactic-weekly-deep-dive-info

Basic React App to display the details of weekly deep dives.

Currently relying on a cors proxy service to access the api, looking to change that in the future.
If I ever get this CORS Error fixed to not rely on a proxy anymore, I'm planning to extend this tool by the following features:

- Countdown to weekly reset
- Build suggestions based on Missions, Warnings and Anomalies (biggest feature, lots of work)
- Maybe host it on my own server, rather than stackblitz. (Which could actually fix the CORS issue, but money)
