# deep-rock-galactic-weekly-deep-dive-info

Basic React-App to fetch and display the details of the weekly deep dives.

Currently relying on a CORS proxy service to access the api, looking to change that in the future.
If the CORS proxy dependency can be fixed, I'm planning to extend this tool by the following features:

- Countdown to weekly reset
- Build suggestions based on Missions, Warnings and Anomalies (biggest feature, lots of work)
- Maybe host it on my own server, rather than stackblitz. (Which could actually fix the CORS issue, but money)
