# deep-rock-galactic-weekly-deep-dive-info

Basic React-App to fetch and display the details of the weekly deep dives.

Planned extensions to this tool:

- Countdown to weekly reset
- Build suggestions based on Missions, Warnings and Anomalies (biggest feature, lots of work)
- Maybe host it on my own server, rather than stackblitz. (Which could actually fix the CORS issue, but money)
